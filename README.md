# Leads Tracker PWA

A progressive web application that allows users to save and manage sales leads. The app uses Firebase for real-time data storage and can be installed as a PWA for easy access across devices.

This project was originally built as part of a Scrimba tutorial and has since been updated with custom styling and UI changes to improve the overall look and user experience.
